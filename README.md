for really shitty security

The purpose of this program is mostly comical. 
While it might end up being useful to someone, it definitely should not be relied upon for security purposes, 
or protection of anyone's property. It's a joke. And a pretty badly written script.

The idea is that if you are in a public place, and you need to go to the bathroom, but are worried that someone will steal your laptop if you leave it alone, you can run this program and your webcam will start broadcasting to an address you can get to on your phone.
